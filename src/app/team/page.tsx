              and MBA degree from South East University. His philanthropic
              journey began in 2009 during his university life when he started
              working for underprivileged and neglected individuals. Assisted by
              his younger brothers and friends, he prioritized the education and
              healthcare of street, homeless, and underprivileged children.
              Starting with informal roadside teaching, he established the first
              campus in 2015, providing formal education to underprivileged
              children. Notable initiatives include{" "}
