        "quote": "In the Sixth Grade Life and Livelihood book, there is a chapter titled \"Skill Course - Cooking,\" which outlines the step-by-step process of preparing simple dishes like rice, fried eggs, and mashed potatoes. This chapter is designed to teach students essential cooking skills in a practical and accessible way. Our students went beyond the textbook by dividing themselves into different groups and preparing a variety of exciting dishes. Some students cooked noodles, others made pudding, and some even prepared chatpati. This allowed the students to explore creativity in cooking while building their practical skills. After cooking, each group presented their dishes to the class, where they shared the detailed recipes, ingredients, and costs involved. Students also discussed their personal experiences, highlighting challenges faced during cooking and what they learned throughout the process. This exercise not only enhanced their cooking abilities but also improved their teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills, preparing them for a well-rounded future.",

This initiative provides hands-on training in sewing, allowing participants to acquire a valuable skill that can support their families financially. \n\n Each batch consists of 30 participants, including both local women and senior students from our campuses.
